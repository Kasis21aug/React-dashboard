## Overview
This project is a React-based Product Dashboard that displays a list of products in a table and supports basic product management features such as editing the product title, deleting a product, and filtering products using dropdown filters. Since the assignment required using dummy data and mock API calls, the entire project is implemented without a real backend and simulates API behavior using `Promise` and `setTimeout`.

---

## Development Approach
I built the project phase-by-phase, focusing on completing one feature at a time to avoid breaking multiple parts together.

### 1) Data Layer (Local Database)
- Created a local product dataset using dummy product data (20–30 products).
- Stored the cleaned product list in a dedicated file (`products.js`) to keep it separate from UI and logic.
- This file acts as the “database” for the project.

### 2) Mock API Layer
To simulate backend behavior, I created a mock API file (`productApi.js`) with:
- `getProducts()` to fetch the product list
- `updateProductTitle(id, newTitle)` to update the title
- `deleteProduct(id)` to remove a product

Each API function returns a Promise with a delay using `setTimeout` to mimic real API response time.

### 3) UI Implementation
The dashboard UI was developed in a structured way:
- Built a table component (`ProductTable.jsx`) to display products.
- Implemented title editing using an input field and saved changes using `onBlur`.
- Added a delete button for each row to remove products using the mock API.
- Added dropdown filters for brand, category, price range, and rating range.

### 4) Filtering Logic
Filters were implemented in the parent component (`Dashboard.jsx`) to keep logic centralized.
- Brand and category dropdown options are dynamically generated based on the currently filtered dataset.
- Price and rating filters were implemented as range-based dropdowns for better usability.

### 5) Extra Improvements
- Added a Reset Filters button to clear all selected filters.
- Implemented loading and error handling during product fetch.
- Displayed a “No results found” message when filters return an empty list.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Edited title not persisting after refresh
**Issue:** After editing a product title, it updated on UI but reverted back after refreshing the page.  
**Solution:** Since the mock backend data resets on refresh, persistence is not automatic. A possible improvement is storing updated data in `localStorage` so changes remain after reload.

### Challenge 2: Dynamic filter values
**Issue:** Filters needed to update based on currently available results (with other filters applied).  
**Solution:** I generated dropdown options by applying all filters except the current one and extracting unique values from the remaining results.

### Challenge 3: Price and rating filtering
**Issue:** Exact value filters were not user-friendly and did not match real-world filtering behavior.  
**Solution:** Implemented price and rating filters using predefined ranges, which improved usability and made filtering more practical.

## Final Outcome
The final dashboard meets the required functionality:
- Displays products in a clean table format
- Supports title editing with mock API save
- Allows deleting products
- Supports dynamic dropdown filtering and range filtering
- Includes reset, loading, error handling, and no-results message

This approach ensured the code stayed modular, beginner-friendly, and easy to extend for future improvements.
